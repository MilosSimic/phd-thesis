First of all, I would like to express my sincere gratitude to my mentors Professor Jovanka Pantovi\' c and Professor Hugo Torres Vieira, for their unselfish help and experienced guidance. Before starting my PhD studies I had no idea what doing research means. They introduced me to the wonderful world of formal methods and  shown me how far one needs to go in order to extract the juice out of his work. Above all, I thank them for always encouraging me to ``keep up the good work'', and for demonstrating what it takes to be a true scientist and a good person. 

To my elementary and high school teachers, and  my professors at the university, thank you for making me prepared for doing the Ph.D.

I would like to thank my colleagues at the Chair of Mathematics at Faculty of Technical Sciences for letting me be part of the family and for sharing all the good and the bad that our job carries. 

To all of my friends, for making my life happier.

To my family, I owe the most. I thank my ``in-law'' family Radovan, Jasna, and Maja, for their great support.
To my sister Draginja, her husband Bojan and my nieces Jelisaveta and Jovana, to my older brother Mladen and his wife Nina, and to my younger brother Aleksandar, thank you for being a perfect family. To my parents Jovanka and Sini\v sa, for their endless love. To my wife Sanja, and our daughters Tamara and Lenka, for their patience, support, and unquestionable love, thank you for being my world.
