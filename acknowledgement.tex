First of all, I would like to express my sincere gratitude to my mentor Professor Goran Sladi\'c for his unselfish help during the process of writing this thesis and related papers.

My research would have been impossible without the aid and support of colleagues Ivan Proki\'c and Jovana Dedei\'c from Chair of Mathematics. Together we manage to finish our research and publish the paper. Before working with them, I had a different view of what research is, and now my view is changed for the better. I hope that we will continue to collaborate in the future, publishing more great papers, and working on interesting and challenging projects and ideas.

I am profoundly grateful to Dejan Miji\'c, who first introduced me to formal models and their importance in the research area of the distributed systems. Before our talk, I had no idea how to actually test, and prove my work. I would blindly try all scenarios that come to my mind and ultimately prove probably nothing.

I would like to thank all my friends, relatives and other people who showed me how not to act, and how to be a better person. To my university professors, teaching assistants and colleagues from Chair of Applied Computer Science, Chair of Informatics who pushed me to reach my full potential, to evolve, and ultimately finish my PhD. I would like to express my gratitude to Biljana Duda\v s for all the good deeds she has done over the years.

Special thanks for my MetaDoktor teammates Vladimir Ivanc\v evi\'c, Marko Knez\v evi\'c and Danica Mandi\'c, our collaboration sparked my interest for doing serious research. I have learned so much from you all.

In the end, I would like to dedicate this work to my grandparents --- I have finished school finally. \emph{"If I have seen further it is by standing on the shoulders of Giants."}\footnote{Isaac Newton letter to Robert Hooke, 1675}.
